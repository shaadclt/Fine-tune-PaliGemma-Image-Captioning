# Fine-tuning PaliGemma for Image Captioning
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune PaliGemma model for image captioning. The PaliGemma model, developed by Google Research, is designed to handle images and generate corresponding captions.

## Overview
The notebook includes the following key steps:

### 1. Setup Environment:

- Environment variables for Kaggle are set up to download model checkpoints.
- The Big Vision repository is cloned, and necessary dependencies are installed.
- JAX is configured, and GPU/TPU devices are made invisible to TensorFlow to avoid conflicts.

### 2. Download Required Files:

- Model checkpoint and tokenizer are downloaded.
- The dataset for training and validation is downloaded.

### 3. Model Definition:

- The PaliGemma model is defined using configuration settings.
- The tokenizer for text processing is loaded.

### 4. Parameter Loading:

- Model parameters are loaded and sharded across devices if multiple GPUs are available.
- The parameters are converted to float32 where necessary.

### 5. Preprocessing Functions:

- Functions for preprocessing images and tokens are defined to prepare data for the model.

### 6. Training and Validation Data:

- Iterators for training and validation data are created.
- Images and captions from the dataset are preprocessed for training and evaluation.

### 7. Training Loop:

A short training loop is implemented using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a cosine learning rate schedule.
Model parameters are updated, and training loss is reported at each step.

### 8. Evaluation:

- The model's performance is evaluated on a validation dataset.
- Predicted captions for validation images are generated and displayed.

### 9. Streamlit Interface:

- A Streamlit interface is created to upload images and generate captions using the trained PALIGEMMA model.

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository:
- Clone the Big Vision repository and install dependencies.

2. Download Model and Data:
- Download the PALIGEMMA model checkpoint, tokenizer, and dataset.

3. Run the Notebook:
- Execute the notebook to preprocess data, load the model, and perform training and evaluation.

4. Streamlit Interface:
- Run the Streamlit interface to upload an image and generate a caption.
  
## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to fine-tune the PaliGemma model for image captioning. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you can train the model on a custom dataset and use it to generate captions for new images.
